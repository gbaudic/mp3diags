The plan is to fix bugs in a timely manner, so potential bugs shouldn't be a big issue even when running the unstable version (at least if you keep backup copies of your MP3s.) Note that fixing bugs is easiest when I can reproduce them or at least have a good idea about what might be causing them. I am aware of several outstanding bugs, which I can't fix due to lack of user feedback: I can't reproduce the bug and I can't make a reasonable guess as to what's causing it, so I need more details from the reporter, but the reporter doesn't provide those details.

<div class="NormalText TitleText RegFnt ChpCol2">
<a name="linuxNotes">Linux</a>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
Linux is the development platform (openSUSE, to be more precise), so the program should work best on Linux. The most
    important requirement is having Qt 5, which is widey available. (An update to Qt 6 should come
    at some future point in time.)
</div>




<div class="NormalText TitleText RegFnt ChpCol1">
<a name="windowsNotes">Windows</a>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
Since this really is a Linux program, there might be some Windows-specific crashes or other issues, so I recommend
    using Linux instead. At any rate, many users had no issue with the program on Windows. Still, there are some reports
    of crashes from Windows users. I try to fix those crashes, but time tends to be an issue.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    There is one outstanding bug causing files to be read-only on Windows 7. There were several reports, and I've seen
    it myself; however, when I wanted to get a closer look, the files became writable again (or perhaps I didn't
    remember their location correctly.) This seems to be related to user rights / file permissions, but for now it's
    an open issue and suggestions about why is this happening and how to make the program work are welcome. Some things
    that I would expect to help in this situation are running the program as an Administrator, copying files to a FAT
    partition, or turning off User Account Control. However, at least in one case these didn't do any good.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    Another known issue is with having the files on external or network drives, including USB sticks. This has been
    reported a number of times, but I was never able to find what the cause is or a potential workaround.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    I tested previous versions of the executable on XP SP1, XP SP2, XP SP3, Vista Home, and Windows 7. Currently, the
    build and tests are done on Windows 10.
</div>


<div class="NormalText TitleText RegFnt ChpCol2">

    in the Fink Project, so it looks like the program should work on OS X; also, several percent of the visits to the
    website are by OS X users. However, I have never heard from any Mac user about their experience with MP3 Diags,
    so I can't really say that it works there. Or perhaps they would have told me if it didn't ...
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    There is an OS/2 port by Elbert Pol. See <a href="http://trac.netlabs.org/qtapps/wiki/QT4%20Multimedia" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/os2/mp3diags');">this page</a> for links.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    I'm not aware of attempts to compile and run the project on other platforms, but I'd like to know if anybody tried
    it and what the results were. At any rate, there is a file that only works with GCC or MSVC, so other compilers
    should fail until that file gets ported. If somebody wants to publish builds, it would probably be a good idea
    to tell me, so I can add a link to the build for that platform.

    There are 2 public repositories, one at SourceForge and one at GitHub. They are supposed to contain the same files.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mp3diags/code-git/ci/master/tree/">Sourceforge page</a>: <span class="Reference">git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/mp3diags/code-git mp3diags-code-git</span> </li>

    </ul>
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    The git repositories store all the tools that are needed to build the project, not just the source code. So you can
    find there the documentation, installer and build scripts, and desktop integration files.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    There are some differences between the sources that you download via Subversion and the ones that you get from
    SourceForge as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3diags/filesQQQBRANCH_SLQQQ/mp3diags-src/"
                      onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/files/src');">source packages</a>, as the
    latter ones are "generated", using <span class="Reference">MakeArchives.sh</span>.
    This script is Linux-specific; there is no Windows equivalent or plan for it (but there are options for running
    it on Windows).
    <span class="Reference">MakeArchives.sh</span> is used to set the correct branch and version number in a number
    of places, mainly the build tools and the documentation, but also several C++ files. It also renames some of the
    files, so they have the branch as part of their name, and moves the documentation files up one folder.
    Or, well, it doesn't do any of these, but it creates a directory called <span class="Reference">package/out</span>
    where it makes a copy of the project that includes these changes.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    The build scripts can be
    used as a starting point for creating binary packages for other .rpm- or Debian- based distributions. It used to be
    necessary to run <span class="Reference">AdjustMt.sh</span> in order
    to account for how dependencies were packaged, but that is probably no longer the case.

There is a pretty standard Windows installer, as well as a zip archive with the executable and the DLLs it needs. Either one of these should be OK:
<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3diags/filesQQQBRANCH_SLQQQ/mp3diags-windows-setup/MP3DiagsSetupQQQBRANCH_DQQQ.exe" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/files/setup');">Windows 64bit installer</a> (if the link doesn't work, there's a copy at my ISP, <a href="http://web.clicknet.ro/mciobanu/mp3diagsQQQBRANCH_SLQQQ/MP3DiagsSetupQQQBRANCH_DQQQ-QQQVERQQQ.exe" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/clicknet/setup');">here</a>) </li>

</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    <b>Note</b>: More likely than not, you will get warnings from Windows about MP3 Diags being an unrecognized and
    potentially harmful program. This is due to MP3 Diags not being registered with Microsoft (which seems to require
    it being distributed by a company, among other things) and not having enough downloads to be considered OK
    automatically. So far I don't have a good solution to this, so all you can do to get the program installed is
    to ignore the warnings, as shown below. (There are a number of opinions on this subject, like <a href=

<a name="binLinux">Linux generic</a>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    Starting with version 0.99.06.043, "generic" Linux executables were provided. They were supposed to work on any
    recent distribution on x86 or x86_64 CPUs but very limited testing was done. The point of having them is to make
    it easier for more people to run MP3 Diags. Please share your experience if you try them. Note that running these
    alternatively with pre-packaged MP3 Diags might lead to the MP3 files being rescanned, due to a different
    serialization library.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    At some point in time I stopped provided them and nobody complained, so I never resumed building them. Older versions
    can be found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mp3diags/filesQQQBRANCH_SLQQQ/mp3diags-linux-bin/">here</a>.

    Even though they are quite old, it's not a huge deal provided that they get started, as there were no major features
    or bad bug fixes after that.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol1">
    If you use these, you'll have to make sure that you have the correct dependencies. All you'll need to add is
    probably Qt 5. If on your distribution the SVG support in Qt 5 is packaged separately, as it is on Debian-based
    distributions, you'll need to add that as well. Note that the program will run without SVG, but the buttons will
    have no icons in such a case. If you have KDE 5.x you probably don't need to add anything.

    Flatpack or Snap are more modern solutions to this problem, but I'm not sure if it's worth the effort.

<a name="uninstall">Uninstallation</a>
</div>


<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    How the uninstallation should proceed depends on how the program was installed. If you installed from sources with
    <span class="Reference">Install.sh</span>, there is an <span class="Reference">Uninstall.sh</span>. If you installed
    on Windows using the installer, you can use both the Control Panel and the "Uninstall" entry created when MP3 Diags
    was installed. If you used a package manager on Linux, use the same thing. If you just copied binaries, remove the
    binaries.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    Keep in mind that besides the executable, there are data files and settings. You probably created some data files,
    and if you are sure you no longer need them you should remove them manually. Note that the data files come in
    pairs. Although you only specify an ".ini" file when you start the program for the first time (or when you
    <a href="310_advanced.html">create a new session</a>), two files get created. The ".ini" only stores settings, while
    the actual data is stored in a file in the same directory and with the same name but with the extension ".dat".
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    Besides the ".ini" and ".dat" files, there is a small configuration file which is named
    <span class="Reference">~/.config/Ciobi/Mp3DiagsQQQBRANCH_DQQQ.conf</span> on Linux and similar systems. That file
    should be removed as well if you want no trace of MP3 Diags left on your computer. (Of course, you lose your
    settings, should you want to reinstall MP3 Diags.) The corresponding place on Windows is the registry entry
    <span class="Reference">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Ciobi\Mp3DiagsQQQBRANCH_DQQQ</span>.
</div>

<div class="NormalText RegFnt ChpCol2">
    If you used shell integration, you should disable it before simply removing the program, so it won't leave garbage
    in your system. This is done automatically by the Windows uninstaller. You can do this manually by running the
    program with the "-u" parameter or by going to the <a href="298_config_shell.html"> Shell integration </a>
    configuration page and unchecking all the options there.
